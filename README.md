# aoc2018

My [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) solutions.

Usage:

```
$ go run . [-d day] [-2]
```

Requires a `session.txt` file containing a session token, for pulling puzzle input and submitting answers.
(Inputs and answers are cached.)

## Benchmarks

I thought it would be fun to share performance [benchmarks](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/#hdr-Benchmarks)
for each of my puzzle solutions, since I write benchmarks anyway to help guide my optimizations.
I don't always optimize for the best possible time if I think it impacts code readability.
Benchmarks use the real puzzle input, which is preloaded in memory.

```
$ go test -bench=.
```
